### Thank you for standing with ETH100 to light the way for Web3.

We firmly believe that knowledge is the most powerful coordination primitive. By transforming dispersed and complex information into timely, coherent narratives, we help the Ethereum community align attention, allocate resources, and take clear, informed actions. ETH100 is our tribute to this collective intelligence.

Our mission is to make cutting-edge blockchain research, technical developments, and protocol insights accessible to everyone. ETH100 offers a vivid blueprint for the future, covering Ethereum’s most critical frontier domains—from data availability and zero-knowledge proofs to MEV, PBS, and beyond.

Knowledge itself demands credible neutrality. We strive to remain unaffected by external pressures, approaching knowledge with rational objectivity, and faithfully serving as a coordination hub for Ethereum and the broader ecosystem.

Your support means the world to our small and independent team. Every contribution matters—thank you for being part of this journey.

We’ve already completed most of the DASBook and are moving into the next phase. You can learn more about our mid-term roadmap in the ETH100 Plan – Ethereum Knowledge Coordination Center, and we warmly welcome your feedback.
